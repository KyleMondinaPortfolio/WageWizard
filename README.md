## Overview
Wage Wizard is a mobile application developed to assist caregivers, particularly those in industries where wage theft is prevalent, in tracking their working hours and wages. The app helps users ensure they are paid fairly by automating work hour logging, providing wage payout estimates, and offering valuable resources to protect against wage theft.

The application was developed as a senior design project by Brett Rimmer, Kyle Mondina, and Jack Davey at Santa Clara University, in collaboration with The Frugal Innovation Hub and the Santa Clara Wage Theft Coalition [^1][^2].

## Key Features
1. **Automated Work Logging**: 
   - Uses GPS-based geofencing to track and log hours worked.
   - Users can also manually log their working hours if necessary.
   
2. **Wage Calculation**: 
   - Provides estimates of expected wages based on logged hours.
   - Alerts users if their estimated wage payout appears to be below the expected rate, potentially indicating wage theft.
   
3. **Privacy and Security**: 
   - All data is stored locally on the user’s device.
   - Data is encrypted and protected by a user-defined PIN, ensuring that sensitive information is secure.
   
4. **User-friendly Design**:
   - Designed to be intuitive and accessible for users of varying tech-savviness.
   - Simple setup and easy-to-follow instructions to accommodate users who may not be familiar with mobile apps.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: The application is cross-platform, developed for both iOS and Android, allowing caregivers to access it regardless of their device.
- **Figma**: Used for designing and prototyping the user interface, ensuring an intuitive and accessible layout [^2].

## Privacy and Security
Wage Wizard is built with privacy in mind. The app does not require extensive personal information, and all sensitive data (such as location-based work logs) is stored securely on the device. Users have the option to export their work logs for use in wage disputes, but this data is only shared at the user’s discretion [^1].
